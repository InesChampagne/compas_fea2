compas_fea2 is a flexible and extensible framework for finite element analysis (FEA) in Python. It is part of the COMPAS framework, which is an open-source, Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in architecture, engineering, and digital fabrication.

Key features of compas_fea2 include:
- **Modularity**: Easily extend and customize the framework to suit specific needs.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate with other COMPAS packages and external software.
- **User-friendly**: Simplifies the setup, execution, and post-processing of FEA simulations.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help users get started quickly.

compas_fea2 supports various types of analyses, including:
- Static analysis
- Modal analysis
- Buckling analysis
- Dynamic analysis

The package is designed to work with different FEA solvers, providing a unified interface for setting up and running simulations. This allows users to switch between solvers without changing their workflow.
